As a planetary geologist, I use remote sensing data and mathematical models to understand planetary bodies, their composition, geology and geochemistry, formation histories, and potential to host life. My research is focused on planetary surface geology and processes and applications of AI/ML to astrobiological exploration. The data I use in my research are hyper- and multispectral reflectance and thermal emission spectra, topographic data, and various other satellite- and small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS)-based products. To augment my remote sensing approach, I conduct field work, employ numerical, analytical, and machine learning models, and perform laboratory and field spectroscopy. My research is highly collaborative, and I work with leading scientists in their field across many institutions, including at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) and the SETI Institute (SI) where I am a Research Affiliate at both institutions, The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), and my home institution, The University of Arizona.
